	on click eye icon (view-order.php) in orders.php page 
		the view-order.php page to have link on click it takes back user to orders page, 
			a button to replicate the order-items into sell.php invoice, such that user can use same order, alters few things and re-complete that order
				(in case the order is cancelled so it is to be re-entered cause customer edited some staffs of the order)
